[00:21.64] My heart is filled, with love and care
[00:23.89] Not an ounce of gas, I would get up there
[00:26.59] The answer's simple
[00:28.53] You lift me up
[00:31.10] The view up here, I see all the stars
[00:33.56] There go Venus, and there go Mars
[00:35.80] Somethin' you been through
[00:38.67] You're from above
[00:47.17] 
[00:41.09] Hey, when I first saw you, I got excited
[00:42.84] Tried to keep my composure, tryna hide it
[00:45.00] But I didn't know
[00:47.11] I didn't let go
[00:49.79] Then it occurred to me while tryna fight it
[00:52.01] Just like a kite, you learn to ride it
[00:54.82] But I didn't know
[01:03.32] 
[00:56.80] You're s'posed to let it go
[01:10.30] 
[00:58.83] Like a gust of wind
[01:00.75] You hit me off sometimes
[01:03.70] Like a gust of wind
[01:05.53] You push me back every once in a while
[01:08.62] Like a gust of wind
[01:10.25] You remind me there's someone up there
[01:29.25] 
[01:13.02] Who whooshes in
[01:15.16] The air I need to power myself
[01:30.16] 
[01:17.80] When I open the window
[01:20.69] I wanna hug you
[01:22.95] 'Cause you remind me of the air
[01:25.68] I said yeah
[01:27.99] 'Cause when I'm feelin' real low
[01:43.99] 
[01:30.25] I remember I love you
[01:32.84] I put my hands in the air
[01:35.14] And you were there
[01:44.14] 
[01:37.94] With your love, I can board the skies
[01:40.74] Finding a way that electrifies, mother's your other
[01:44.78] Cannot stow away
[01:52.78] 
[01:47.34] Telephone winds of the northern sky
[01:50.01] Is the closest thing, and here is why
[01:52.77] 'Cause we're color
[01:54.22] You blow me away
[02:02.22] 
[01:56.22] I need you, like I'm breathing
[02:00.14] Music umbrellas can make one cover
[02:02.06] Who cares if they don't see you
[02:17.56] 
[02:04.67] Don't you know that they're the same
[02:06.89] I need it like I'm breathing
[02:09.58] If you never discover, forever you'll suffer
[02:11.82] Who cares if they don't see you
[02:27.32] 
[02:13.92] You got until then to learn the way
[02:16.18] Like a gust of wind
[02:17.28] You hit me off sometimes
[02:29.28] 
[02:20.41] Like a gust of wind
[02:22.10] You push me back every once in a while
[02:25.06] Like a gust of wind
[02:27.03] You remind me there's someone up there
[02:29.86] Who whooshes in
[02:37.36] 
[02:31.32] The air I need to power myself
[02:34.86] When I open the window
[02:37.25] I wanna hug you
[02:39.88] 'Cause you remind me of the air
[02:42.27] I said yeah
[02:44.56] 'Cause when I'm feelin' real low
[02:47.07] I remember I love you
[02:49.36] I put my hands in the air
[02:51.82] And you were there

[03:20.98] I didn't let go
[03:23.35] Then I realized I'm tryna fight it
[03:26.19] Just so they can learn to ride it
[03:28.42] But I didn't know
[03:30.48] I had to let it go
[03:32.33] Like a gust of wind
